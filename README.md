# 🚦 Traffic Predictor Web App
Predict real-time traffic duration 30 minutes ahead using LSTM and  data captured using Google Maps API.

# ✨ Features
- Predicts traffic 30 minutes ahead
- Route selection
- LSTM-based time series model
- Streamlit web interface

#How it works ? ❓
- it have  dataset of 3 routes , for 4-5 days
- takes that data compare to LSTM model , Time Past Historical Based Prediction
