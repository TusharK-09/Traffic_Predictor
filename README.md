# 🚦 Traffic Predictor Web App
Predict real-time traffic duration 30 minutes ahead using LSTM and  data captured using Google Maps API.

A machine learning-based web application that predicts traffic duration 30 minutes ahead for a given route using past traffic data. Built using LSTM neural networks, Streamlit, and PyTorch.

It helps users anticipate traffic and plan travel better. Deployed locally for privacy and performance, data collected and modeled by Tushar.

## ✨ Features
- Predicts traffic 30 minutes ahead
- Route selection
- LSTM-based time series model
- Streamlit web interface

##How it works ? ❓
- it have  dataset of 3 routes , for 4-5 days
- takes that data compare to LSTM model , Time Past Historical Based Prediction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy 
- PyTorch (LSTM)
- Streamlit - to present as WEB
- scikit-learn


## **Future Improvements 
```markdown
## 🔧 plans
- Add live Google Maps API integration
- Improve model accuracy with more data
